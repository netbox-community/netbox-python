## General Tips for Working on GitHub

* Register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't already.
* You can use [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for formatting text and adding images.
* To help mitigate notification spam, please avoid "bumping" issues with no activity. (To vote an issue up or down, use a :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: reaction.)
* Please avoid pinging members with `@` unless they've previously expressed interest or involvement with that particular issue.
* Familiarize yourself with [this list of discussion anti-patterns](https://github.com/bradfitz/issue-tracker-behaviors) and make every effort to avoid them.

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox_python/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

NetBox Python could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official NetBox Python docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox_python/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `netbox_python` for local development.

1. Fork the `netbox_python` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/netbox_python.git
    ```

3. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv:

    ```
    $ poetry install -E test -E doc -E dev
    ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

    ```
    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
   tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox:

    ```
    $ poetry run tox
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. Check
   https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox_python/actions
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.


## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in CHANGELOG.md).
Then run:

```
$ poetry run bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags
```

GitHub Actions will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
